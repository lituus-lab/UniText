# Unmangled C symbols, C calling convention, exported from the shared lib.
# --noMain suppresses the generated entry point and with it every auto-init
# hook: neither the static nor the shared build emits a DllMain or an ELF
# constructor, so nothing initializes the Nim runtime. The first entry point
# then enters Nim code whose globals were never set up. The shared build was
# assumed to be covered by a loader hook it does not have -- its registries
# stayed empty and the contrast entry answered nan. Every --noMain task passes
# -d:noAutoInit; an ordinary executable linking this module must not, since its
# own main already ran NimMain.
when defined(noAutoInit):
  # A once primitive, not a plain flag: two threads reaching an entry point
  # together would both see the flag unset, both call NimMain, and the second
  # would enter Nim code the first had not finished initializing. The platform
  # primitives block the losers until the winner returns, which a flag cannot.
  #
  # C statics, not Nim globals: module initialization would reset a Nim one and
  # NimMain would run again. NimMain is declared here too — the generated
  # prototype comes after this section.
