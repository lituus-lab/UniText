# is printed, the task stops, and the process still reports success. Neither
# `try`/`except` nor `quit(1)` inside a task changes it — measured, not
# assumed — so nothing written here can make nimble's exit code trustworthy.
#
# Each task therefore ends with `done "<its own name>"`, which drops a marker
# file, and `tools/gate.nim` is what turns a missing marker into a non-zero
# exit. Run a task through the gate, never bare, wherever the answer matters:
# in CI, and in any task that composes another.
# actions/setup-python puts only `python.exe` on PATH under Windows; every
# other platform here ships `python3`.
