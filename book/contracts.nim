# Contracts

`fibonacci` carries a precondition — `n` in `[0, FibMaxN]` — written with
NimContracts and compiled away under `-d:release`. This chapter shows what a
violation does, because a contract described in prose is a contract nobody has
seen fire.

Everything below is produced by compiling and running a fragment during the
book build. None of it is transcribed.

## In a debug build, the precondition raises

const Violation = """

  echo runNim("debug", Violation, "")

nbText: """
`PreConditionDefect` names the predicate that broke and where it was promised.
It is a `Defect`, not a `CatchableError`: it reports a caller's mistake, not a
condition the caller could recover from.

## Under `-d:release`, the same call is not checked

The contract compiles away entirely — that is what makes it free in production.
What the function does out of domain is then whatever the arithmetic does.
"""

nbCode:
  echo runNim("release", Violation, "-d:release")

nbText: """
Below the domain the release build returns a number; the guard that would have
refused it is gone. Above the domain it aborts on overflow. Neither is a
contract violation any more — there is no contract in a release build.

**This is the reason the C ABI exists in the shape it does.** A foreign caller
gets neither the debug check nor a Nim exception, so the boundary cannot rely
on either. The next chapter is what it does instead.

## What a postcondition is for

`ensure: result >= 0` is checked on the way out, in debug. It is deliberately
weaker than "the result is the nth Fibonacci number": a postcondition that
recomputed the answer would double the cost and prove only that the function
agrees with itself.
