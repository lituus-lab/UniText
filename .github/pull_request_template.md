## What changes, and why

<!-- The problem, then the fix. Link the issue if there is one. -->

## AI assistance

<!-- Optional disclosure — not a gate. The DCO sign-off is the accountability
     mechanism; the human contributor owns the change either way. -->
- [ ] I used AI/LLM assistance for this change

If yes, I have reviewed the output, ensured it introduces no third-party code
without a compatible license/attribution, and can stand behind it.

## Checks

- [ ] Every commit carries `Signed-off-by:` (`git commit -s`) — the DCO job blocks otherwise
- [ ] Commits and this PR title follow Conventional Commits — the `commitizen` job blocks otherwise
- [ ] Commits are atomic (one logical change each; several per PR is fine, but not one monolithic commit)
- [ ] `build/unigate testAll` passes — through the gate, not `nimble` bare
- [ ] `build/unigate lint` and `build/unigate checkVGraph` pass
- [ ] C ABI touched → `include/UniText.h` updated in the same commit
- [ ] Public API touched → `book/index.nim` still builds and describes it
